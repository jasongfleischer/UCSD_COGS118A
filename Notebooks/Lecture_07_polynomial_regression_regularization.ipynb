    "One technique that is often used to control the over-fitting phenomenon in such cases is that of **regularization**, which involves adding a penalty term to the error function below in order to discourage the coefficients from reaching large values. By preventing the sum of our weights from growing large, we are preventing complex fitting... the total amount of weight allowed will be preferentially allocated to the most important features, preventing features that have less effect on the answer from getting too much love from the algorithm.\n",

You use this technique when it seems appropriate to you that less-important factors have no influence on the solution.

Let's say you have data about the expression levels of ~27,000 protein coding genes across a few thousand humans, and you want to dermine if any of the genes have an effect on a disease.  Since almost NONE of them will, it's good to use something like a heavy L1 penalty, which will prevent you from picking up too much on random chance associations that may exist in the data.\n",
